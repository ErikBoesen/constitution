\title{Team 1418 - Unified Organizational Constitution}
\author{Erik Boesen}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction & Motivations}
This document (hereinafter referred to as the "UOC") serves as a formalized outline of Team 1418's organizational structure and procedures. Team 1418 is a FIRST Robotics Competition team in Falls Church, VA, founded in 2004. Team 1418 is comprised of students from George Mason High School.

This document was created in the pre-season period of the 2019 FRC season. Prior to that point, Team 1418 had relied on an informal leadership structure. The UOC was initially designed, though is not limited, to several ends:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{To formalize a consistent strategy for appointing team captains and other leadership,}
  \item{To define a clear process for applications to the team, and create a procedural framework for handling membership, and}
  \item{To define duties and organizational responsibilities of team leadership, members, and mentors.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Amending}
This document may be amended through an affiramative vote of 3/4 of members as defined herein, with the approval of at least one mentor.

\section{Drive Team}
The drive team must always contain at least one programmer and more than one mechanic.

When a driver graduates, new drivers should be as far from graduating as possible. This way, students will be able to remain in driving positions for multiple years, developing their skills and preparing to drive better when they're seniors. Seniors should not be selected as new drivers as they will graduate after a year, leaving the team with an inexperienced driver yet again.
